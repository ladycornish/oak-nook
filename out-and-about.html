          Galleywood Common is a pleasant open space about 3 miles from
          Chelmsford enjoyed by walkers, cyclists and horse riders.
          <br />
          <br />
          Though it is tranquil today the Common has a surprising history. The
          land has been trampled by racehorses and farm animals, dug up to make
          bricks and taken over by the military.
          <br />

            class="racecourse-img"
          />
          <br />Galleywood Common covers a large area of some 47 hectares. It
          was originally an ancient forest and was recorded in the 1086 Domesday
          Survey. It is now registered as Common Land and managed by Chelmsford
          City Council. It has been designated as a Local Nature Reserve.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Common provides a unique mix of recreation, biodiversity and
          historical features which attract large numbers of visitors who enjoy
          walking, cycling, horse riding and more. If you’re looking for things
          to do in Chelmsford, add this green space to your list for a visit.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Common comprises a mosaic of interrelated habitats: including
          lowland heath, grassland, ponds, mire and wet heath, in addition to
          sizeable woodland – making it a diverse green area to enjoy and
          explore.
